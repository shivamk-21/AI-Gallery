# Gallery Project

Welcome to the AI Gallery Project! This project is designed to use AI technology to search for images base don the query.

## Features

- Display a gallery of images based on a query
- The App matches the query with the visual description of images
- The user needs to index the images once to the app by using the 'Add Images to App' button
- Once indexed, the user can then search for images using the query without the need to index again and again.
- Currently, if the user makes chanegs in the original images folder, then needs to index it again for newer images.
